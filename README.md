# Financial Statement Generation through SimFin API

Before I begin, I find it absolutely necessary to thank [@SimFin](https://github.com/SimFin) for free access to this data via their API. 

## This code is being redesigned, as it was one of the first projects I undertook and improvements in the underlying structure are being prioritized prior to adding new capabilities. The deprecated code scripts however, still do work. They can be found and utilized through the *Deprecated* folder. They will remain there until all of the capabilities of the original program are replicated using the new layout. Necessary README information can be found in that folder. 

## Current Use Cases

The program pulls data from the SimFin API. It can be displayed in an iPython terminal (in pandas format). More functionality is available via the Deprecated folder.

This program only supports annual financials at this time
